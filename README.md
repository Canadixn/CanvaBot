#### config.json
You'll need to enter your [Bot's Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the first string of the raw JSON format.
```json 
{
  "token": "Hey! Your bot token goes here :D",
  "prefix": ""
}
```
You'll then need to enter your **Bot's prefix** on the other string of the raw JSON format.
```json 
{
  "token": "Hey! Your bot token goes here :D",
  "prefix": "Hey! Your bot prefix goes here :D"
}
